	- 3
		- PET structure  MR funtional
		- anatomy and physiologic function information
		- simple overlap ， not aligned
	- 4
		- global feature
			- maybe small part of the images are not aligned
	- 5、 for the first question
		- the method is simple -- DNN could extract local features when the layers are deeper and deeper
			- A DNN to perform binary classification
			- stack them to a two channel tensor
			- use the layer before
			- my work
	- 6、some problems with the first method
		- we just label motion and notmotion,it is a binary classification model
			- so we propose a GNN model
			- the whole structure
