		  id:: 652153aa-88d3-4157-be31-f1ec6870b86e
		- Because an edge computer  -- The computing power of computers is limited
		- to help transfer data in real time , so we need to lightweight the model
		- Yolov5 is available for four versions， we tested the YOLOV5S（represent small）is best suit the edge computer( fastest and recognition accuracy is not bad)
		- Then we tried to improve the origin Yolov5s model:　add attention mechanism ：CBAM（Convolutional Block Attention Module），add GhostCONV（The ghost Convolutionalmodule）
			- CBAM: consists of two submodule Channel Attention Module and the Spartial Attention Module
			- CAM ：The features are first average-pooled and maximum-pooled, and then the average-pooled features and maximum-pooled features are put into MLP（the multilayer perceptron ） to get the final channel attention feature map
			- SAM: the same as the CAM，but the features after pooling are stacked layer by layer and then Use a convolution operation to produce the final spatial attention feature map
		- GhostConv：
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1696683920778_0.png){:height 321, :width 374}
			- **A number of output features were found to be very similar**, and the feature maps in the red, green, and blue boxes in the figure were found by the authors to be very similar, and **basically could be obtained by performing a simple linear transformation** ， **but not by convolutional operation**
			- So the **convolutional operation was reduced** and the output **is consist of two parts**，one part by convolutional operation and part by the linear transformation of the convolutional operation.

- **帕金森评级系统** spatio-temporal graph neural networks to automatically rate the movement videos of Parkinson's patients.
  collapsed:: true
	- 背景：
		- Presently, the main clinical assessment criterion for PD patients is the Unified Parkinson’sDisease Rating Scale (UPDRS). when testing, a trained and experienced neurologist asks the patient to do some tasks like Lift your foot high and hit the ground, or Stand up with your hands folded in front of your chest
		- and the neurologist will rate the movement with 1 ,2,3,4
	- 问题产生：
		- experienced neurologist are mainly in big cities and there is just a small number of them.
		- difficult for the patients to walk, some area have traffic districtions
		- it is time-consuming, one and a half a hour on average.
	- 目标：
		- so we want to design an automated motor function assessment system for remote monitoring of PD patients
	- 解决方案：
		- use ST-GCN to spatial temporal graph neuro network to solve the problem.
	- ST - GCN
		- 使用openpose构建 spatial-temporal graph
		- mainly based on the essay ：Spatial Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Skeleton Based Action Recognition
		- 第一步：
			- First analogize the CNN model
			- Sampling function and weighting function
			- But the graph is different from image：
				- the parameters of a weight function for a single feature map, is the same
					- But the graph, each node has different neighbor nodes
					- So the weight function should differ from nodes to nodes
				- and the sampling function:
					- segmentation strategy
		- The **segmentation strategy** is the most important
			- uni-labeling: Divide the 1-neighborhood of a node into a subset
			- distance segmentation
			- spatial configuration partitioning: into 3 subsets: regarding the distance of the node to the center node
