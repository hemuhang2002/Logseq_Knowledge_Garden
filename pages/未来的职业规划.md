- 准备毕业后继续从事研究，应用层面的研究总是非常的激动人心，无论是我之前接触到的硬件层面的机器人系统，还是后来学习的视觉识别以及现在正在学习的图神经网络，将数学、物理、计算机等知识融合，制造新的设备或者算法对我而言都是很有趣，很贴近我的生活的。

- as for me now，I want to continue pursuing research after graduation, especially in the  applied research. Whether it's the hardware-level robotic systems I have previously worked with, the computer vision I have studied later, or the graph neural networks I am currently learning, combining knowledge from mathematics, physics, computer science, and other fields to create new devices or algorithms is fascinating and closely aligned with my interests and daily life.
