- first stage 首先一个新的领域肯定有未知的东西，看领域的论文综述，确定哪些基础知识是需要学习或者复习的，比如高等数学、线性代数。最好可以和实验室导师、师兄师姐进行沟通，他们或许可以给我方法。
	- First of all there are definitely unknown things in a new field, look at the review of papers in the field and determine which basics I need to learn or review, such as advanced math and linear algebra. It is best to communicate with lab instructors and siblings, they may be able to give me methods.
- second stage：阅读大量文献，实现代码
	- Read a lot of literature and implement the code
- 这么说太简单了，每一步都是需要去时间去学习的
	- That's too easy to say. Every step is a learning curve that takes time.
